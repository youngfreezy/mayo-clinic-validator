    "content": "Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Type 1 diabetes results from the pancreas's failure to produce enough insulin due to loss of beta cells. Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance, where cells fail to respond to insulin properly. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke, diabetic retinopathy leading to blindness, and poor blood flow in the limbs leading to amputations.\n\nType 2 diabetes is largely preventable. Risk factors include being overweight, physical inactivity, family history, age over 45, history of gestational diabetes, prediabetes, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels.\n\nBlood sugar control is central to diabetes management. A1C test measures average blood sugar over two to three months. Target A1C for most people with diabetes is below 7%. Normal A1C is below 5.7%; prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%; diabetes is 6.5% or higher.",

    "content": "Diabetes treatment depends on type. Type 1 diabetes requires insulin therapy — multiple daily injections or an insulin pump. Type 2 diabetes treatment starts with lifestyle changes: healthy eating, regular exercise (at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week), and weight loss. Medications include metformin (first-line), SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and insulin when needed.\n\nMonitoring blood sugar regularly is essential. People with Type 1 should check multiple times daily. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) can provide real-time readings. Hypoglycemia (blood sugar below 70 mg/dL) symptoms include shakiness, sweating, confusion, and can be life-threatening. Treat with 15g of fast-acting carbohydrates (glucose tablets, juice).\n\nDiabetes complications can be delayed or prevented with good blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol control. Annual foot exams, eye exams, and kidney function tests (eGFR, urine albumin) are recommended for people with diabetes.",

    "content": "High blood pressure (hypertension) is a common condition where the long-term force of blood against artery walls is high enough to cause health problems like heart disease. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mmHg. Elevated: 120-129 systolic and below 80 diastolic. Stage 1 hypertension: 130-139/80-89. Stage 2: 140+ systolic or 90+ diastolic. Hypertensive crisis: above 180/120.\n\nMost people with high blood pressure have no symptoms, even if readings are dangerously high. A few people with high blood pressure may have headaches, shortness of breath, or nosebleeds. These symptoms aren't specific and usually don't occur until blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage.\n\nRisk factors include age (risk increases with age), race (more common in Black adults), family history, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, tobacco use, too much sodium, low potassium, excessive alcohol, stress, and certain chronic conditions.",

Most people need more than one medication to control blood pressure. Home monitoring is encouraged — take readings at the same time each day, rest 5 minutes before measuring, take two readings 1 minute apart.",

It develops when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen and nutrients (coronary arteries) become damaged or diseased. Cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) in the arteries and inflammation are usually to blame for coronary artery disease.\n\nSymptoms: Chest pain (angina) — pressure, tightness, burning, or aching in the chest, usually on the left side; shortness of breath; heart attack symptoms include crushing chest pressure, sweating, nausea, upper arm or jaw pain. Women may experience atypical symptoms including fatigue, nausea, and back or jaw pain.\n\nRisk factors: Age, sex (men at higher risk; women's risk increases after menopause), family history, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, high stress, unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol.\n\nHeart attack: Complete blockage of a coronary artery. Treatment within 90 minutes (door-to-balloon time) is critical. Treatments: thrombolytics, PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention/stenting), CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting surgery).",

Women at high risk (BRCA mutation, strong family history) may need earlier screening and MRI.\n\nColorectal cancer: Screening starting at age 45 for average-risk adults. Options include colonoscopy every 10 years, annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT), stool DNA test every 1-3 years, CT colonography every 5 years. Earlier screening for family history of colon cancer.\n\nLung cancer: Annual low-dose CT scan for adults 50-80 with 20+ pack-year smoking history who currently smoke or quit within past 15 years.\n\nProstate cancer: PSA test discussion starting at 50 for average risk, 40-45 for high risk. Shared decision-making recommended.\n\nCervical cancer: Pap smear every 3 years for ages 21-29; Pap + HPV co-test every 5 years for ages 30-65. HPV vaccination recommended through age 26.\n\nSkin cancer: Annual skin exam by dermatologist recommended, especially for those with numerous moles, fair skin, or history of sun exposure.",

Symptoms: persistent sad, anxious, or empty mood; loss of interest or pleasure in activities; changes in appetite; sleep problems; loss of energy; difficulty thinking or concentrating; thoughts of death or suicide.\n\nDiagnosis: DSM-5 criteria — 5 or more symptoms for at least 2 weeks, including depressed mood or loss of interest. PHQ-9 is a validated screening tool.\n\nTreatment: Psychotherapy (CBT is most evidence-based), medication (SSRIs: fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram; SNRIs: venlafaxine, duloxetine), or combination. Most people respond within 4-8 weeks. Medication should be continued 6-12 months after remission to prevent relapse. For severe or treatment-resistant depression: TMS, ECT, ketamine/esketamine (Spravato).\n\nAnxiety disorders: GAD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder. Treatment: CBT, SSRIs/SNRIs, buspirone for GAD. Benzodiazepines for short-term relief only — avoid long-term use due to dependence risk.\n\nSuicide prevention: If in crisis, contact 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (call or text 988).",

Symptoms range from mild (fever, cough, fatigue, loss of taste/smell) to severe (difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion). Long COVID: symptoms persisting 4+ weeks after infection, including fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, post-exertional malaise.\n\nVaccines: mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna) and protein subunit (Novavax) are highly effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death.
